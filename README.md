# WebGL-Globe
Global data visualization using WebGL Globe and OpenWeatherMap API

Using the OpenWeatherMap API, I used a python script to gather the geolocation 
of all the major cities around the world. I then recieved the temperature data from 
those cities in degrees celsius. With all the needed data, I then converted the data 
into the required JSON format that the globe accepted. After I converted the data back to
JSON, I then loaded the data into the globe file to be displayed properly. After a few tweeks
to the file, I then uploaded everything to my website, http://builditsociety.com/projects.html.
